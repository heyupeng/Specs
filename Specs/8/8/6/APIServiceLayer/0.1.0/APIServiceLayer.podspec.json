  "description": "'NetworkLayer is a Swift networking library that simplifies making API requests and handling responses. It includes a singleton NetworkManager for global use, and an APIHandler class for managing network calls with Combine. The library supports reactive programming with Swiftâ€™s Combine framework, and provides clear, custom error handling through a NetworkError enum. It ensures easy-to-manage networking, clean data decoding, and error mapping, making it ideal for Swift applications that require robust network communication.'",
