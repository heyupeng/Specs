  "description": "This library is created because of the need to sometimes use tRPC APIs on native platforms.\nIt is only recommended that you use this as a tranitional solution when there's an existing\ntRPC API and you want to use it in your Swift app without too much difficulty. It isn't\nrecommended that you use this as your primary and only solution in production, as it breaks\nthe type-safe philosofy of tRPC by itself, but if you want a challenge, you absolutely may.\n(There is certainly no limitation for this in LICENSE :3 )",
